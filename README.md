# Bike Sharing Rental Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to predict the number of bike rentals in a bike-sharing program. The dataset contains data from a bike-sharing company, capturing rental counts over a period of time, along with various features like weather conditions, time of day, and other factors that influence the rental demand.

## Key Objectives:
- **Modeling Count Data**: Implement Poisson Regression and Random Forest Regression to model the count of bike rentals based on predictors.
- **Comparing Models**: Compare Poisson regression with  Random Forest Regression to assess performance on predicting bike rentals.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore how features such as temperature, weather, and time of day affect bike rental frequency.
