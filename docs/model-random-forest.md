# Random Forest Regression for Continuous Data Prediction

Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning model widely used for both high-dimensional data classification and continuous value prediction. This algorithm constructs multiple decision trees during the training phase and combines their outputs by averaging predictions to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting. In our case, it is applied to predict the number of bike rentals for each day, leveraging its ability to handle complex relationships in the data.

Random Forest works by building multiple decision trees, each created from a subset of the data and based on the relationship between the target variable and the independent features. At each node, it recursively selects the best split based on the features, improving the model’s ability to make accurate predictions. Once all trees are built, their predictions are aggregated—either by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification)—to give the final result. This ensemble approach reduces overfitting and enhances prediction accuracy, making it especially effective for complex datasets.

### Issues with Random Forest

Random Forest for regression is a powerful technique but has several challenges:

- Interpretability: The complexity of multiple decision trees makes it hard to understand model predictions and feature contributions.

- Overfitting: It can still overfit, especially if too complex, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.

- Computational Cost: Building many trees requires substantial memory and processing resources, especially with large datasets.

- Bias-Variance Tradeoff: While it reduces variance, it may have higher bias, depending on the data distribution.

- Feature Importance Bias: The method for assessing feature importance can favor misleadingly informative features.

- Imbalanced Data: It may struggle with significant imbalances in the target variable, affecting prediction quality.
