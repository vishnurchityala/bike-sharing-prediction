# Poisson's Regression for Continuours Data Prediction

Poisson regression is a powerful statistical tool used to model count data, named after the mathematician Sim√©on Denis Poisson, whose work significantly advanced probability theory. This technique is especially useful in fields such as epidemiology, economics, and social sciences, where the goal is to predict the frequency or count of events. By understanding and applying Poisson regression, analysts can gain valuable insights into patterns and occurrences within count-based data. This method has become an essential approach for studying situations where the response variable is a count of events.
