# Random Forest Regression for Continuous Data Prediction

Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning model widely used for both high-dimensional data classification and continuous value prediction. This algorithm constructs multiple decision trees during the training phase and combines their outputs by averaging predictions to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting. In our case, it is applied to predict the number of bike rentals for each day, leveraging its ability to handle complex relationships in the data.
